# Introduction

Spotting queen cells and understanding what they are telling you is important for both managing swarming, and understanding what the colony wants to do with their queen.

There are 3 types of queen events that we're going to cover here. Knowing how to determine which is which is important for managing your colony well:
1. Emergency Cells
2. Supersedure Cells
3. Swarm Cells

We would be remiss at this stage to not point out that all of this is *extremely* flexible. Sometimes a colony might drawn swarm cells on the face of the comb, and only make two of them.

# Types of Queen Cells (QCs)

## Emergency Cells

* Emergency cells are raised from existing brood
    * They can use freshly laid eggs, right up to larvae that are 2-3 days old - that is to say bees that are 5-6 days post laying
* These cells are usually drawn on the face of the comb in the middle of the brood
* They are not usually on the edge of the frames
* Usually only a handful
    * Anywhere from 1-5 cells is normal, though there are often more than supersedures

## Supersedure Cells

* Very similar to emergency cells in all apsects
* Supersedures can be placed anywhere on the frame
* Usually only a small handful
    * Anywhere from 1-5 cells is normal

## Swarm Cells

* Cells usually on the borders of the frame - out of the way
* Not usually placed on top of brood, though might be where comb is port hole through the frames
* Usually they are plentiful
    * Anywhere from 5-40 cells is normal
    * A colony very intent on swarming will cover the bottom of frames with queen cells
